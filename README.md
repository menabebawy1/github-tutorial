## Git vs. GitHub

##### What is git?
Git is _version control software_ that helps you save your work. It allows you to save your changes as you progress and you can refer back to any version of your work whenever you want. Unlike Github, git runs locally. Meaning that the work you do on git is only saved on your device. Git also does not need Github to run in order to work.
##### What is github?
Github is where you save your repository. **Unlike git, github requires git in order to run.** Github also runs in the cloud where you can save all your changes without having to worry about losing them. You can use github to work with others on the same project simultaneously without affecting each other's work. You can also see your changes in order and return your project to an older version if you decide to do so.

2. Type in `git init` in order to make a new repository.
3. Make the changes you need to your README file and wait until it is saved.
4. Add your file to the staging area by typing in `git add .`. This will add your file to be commited.
5. You will then need to commit your files by typing in `git commit -m "message name"`. _Make sure that your message is appropriate; it should tell you what changes you made and be in the present tense. _EX: "fix screenshot"_
6. You will then need to go to github and create a repository by going to the top right corner and pressing on the + and then clicking on "new repository". As shown Above:

## Workflow & Commands

 3. Type `git status` in order to _see if the files are added or not_.
 4. You will then need to _commit your files_ using `git commit -m "Message name"`.
 5. You will finally need to _push your files_ where you will see them on github using `git push`.
 6. Type `git status` to _see your pushed and saved files_.
